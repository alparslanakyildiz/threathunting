Threat Hunting Queries for Splunk and ELK

This repository provides a growing collection of threat hunting queries built for Splunk and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) environments. These queries are designed to help security analysts detect suspicious behavior, investigate potential incidents, and improve visibility across enterprise systems.

Covered use cases include:

Suspicious PowerShell and mshta activity

Lateral movement via SMB and FTP

Anomalous network connections

EventLog and Sysmon-based analysis

IP-focused investigation

Each query is written for practical, real-world use in SOCs, blue teams, and threat detection labs. Feel free to contribute or fork for your own needs.
